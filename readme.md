# NLP Tutorial Series

Welcome to the **NLP Tutorial Series** repository!

This repository is dedicated to providing tutorials on Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering hands-on examples, explanations, and resources. Whether you are just starting or looking to expand your knowledge of NLP, you'll find valuable insights and practical content here.

## What is NLP?

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) focused on enabling machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. NLP is a key technology behind applications like chatbots, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and information retrieval.

Some key applications of NLP include:
- **Text Analysis**: Extracting valuable information from text data.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in a text.
- **Machine Translation**: Translating text from one language to another.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying and classifying named entities such as people, organizations, and locations.
- **Text Summarization**: Creating concise summaries of long documents.
- **Question Answering**: Building systems that can answer questions based on provided text.

## Learning Resources

In this repository, you will find a variety of resources designed to help you learn NLP effectively:
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive code examples with detailed explanations.
- **Datasets**: Datasets for practicing and experimenting with NLP techniques.
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides on various NLP topics.
- **External References**: Links to helpful articles, books, and research papers.

## Series Structure

This series covers a range of topics in NLP, starting with the fundamentals and progressing to more advanced techniques. The series includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction to NLP**: An overview of NLP, key concepts, and basic tasks.
2. **Preprocessing and Text Cleaning**: Techniques for preparing text data for analysis.
3. **Text Classification**: Building models to categorize text into predefined labels.
4. **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities in text.
5. **Word Embeddings**: Representing words as vectors for machine learning.
6. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzing the sentiment expressed in text.
7. **Text Generation**: Generating text using language models.
8. **Sequence-to-Sequence Models**: Building models for tasks like machine translation.
9. **Chatbots and Conversational AI**: Creating intelligent bots capable of engaging in conversation.
10. **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Exploring deep learning models, transformers, and other advanced methods.
